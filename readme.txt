This is a project to provide a common sandbox applications to test different single sign on solutions. It include three applications: one ASP.NET MVC app, one ASP.NET Web Form app and one Windows Winform desktop app. The applications were built with .NET 4.0 as the targeted CLR version. We expect you library support this CLR version and above. This sandbox code was developed in VS2013. But you may downgrade it to VS2012 if necessary. The two web applications were configured to be hosted in IISExpress with specific ports: 53618 and 9654. If your test/dev environment does not use IISExpress or you have conflict with the port, you may change the configuration and also the links between the apps. The locations where we expect you to show your function were marked with “// TODO”. Please feel free to make necessary changes around those areas. If you have more advanced functions, such as using authentication module, feel free to add it and show us the integration code/setting. Between our code and your code, we expect there is a minimum contract in between: We expect your code to support the System.Security.Principal.IPrincipal interface. If your code also support System.Security.Claims.ClaimsPrincipal that would be a plus.
